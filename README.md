Overview
The code illustrates a common pattern in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations in sequence. Each Promise resolves after a certain delay, simulating API calls or other async tasks.

Code Explanation
Promise Chain Structure
First Promise: Resolves after 3 seconds

Second Promise: Starts after the first resolves, then takes 2 seconds

Third Promise: Starts after the second resolves, then takes 1 second

Error Handling: A .catch() at the end handles any rejections in the chain

Key Features
Sequential execution of asynchronous operations

Proper promise chaining with return statements

Centralized error handling
